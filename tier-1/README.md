# Tier 1 Questions

There are only 2 questions here:

### Vowel Counting

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).
The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

### Square Every Digit

We are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)
Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 5 is 25. (49-36-25)
