### Bit Counting

Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

### Count All Nodes

Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees), every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
